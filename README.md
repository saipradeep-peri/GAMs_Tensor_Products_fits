GAMs with Tensor Product Spline smoothers for handling 2D interaction data

# 1D smooths
This folder consists of code on 1D - fits of smoothing splines using different spline types.

The manual regulariztion is done using 'optim' (I am still exploring more methods for speeding this training process).

Checkout my [blog](https://medium.com/@saipradeep.peri/gams-and-smoothing-splines-part-1-simplified-8c5e2c10dbaa) on medium explaining general idea of GAMs - 1D smoothing splines fit.
