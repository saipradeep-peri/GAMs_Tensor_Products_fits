GAMs with Tensor Product Spline smoothers for handling 2D interaction data

# 1D smooths
This folder consists of code on 1D - fits of smoothing splines using different spline types.

The manual regulariztion is done using 'optim' (I am still exploring more methods for speeding this training process).
